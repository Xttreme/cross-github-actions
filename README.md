## Introduction

DevSecOps is the combination of development, security, and operations practices to create a culture of security throughout the software development lifecycle. This repository serves as a guide to our DevSecOps pipeline, which integrates security into every stage of our software development process.

## Pipeline Overview

Our DevSecOps pipeline automates various stages of the software development process, from code creation to deployment. This ensures that our software is developed, tested, and deployed securely and efficiently. Key features of our pipeline include:

- Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Automated testing and code analysis
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Compliance checks and auditing
- Monitoring and incident response

## Tools and Technologies

Our DevSecOps pipeline utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to achieve its goals. Some of the core tools and technologies we use include:

- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment:** GitHub Actions
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform
- **Security Scanning:** SonarQube
- **Vulnerability Management:** 

## Getting Started

To get started with our DevSecOps pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md) for detailed instructions on setting up the pipeline locally.
3. Explore the [Configuration](./config) directory to understand how our pipeline is configured.
4. Refer to the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you wish to contribute to the pipeline's development.

## Pipeline Stages

Our DevSecOps pipeline consists of several stages that are executed in sequence:

1. **Code Development:** Developers write code and submit pull requests.
2. **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automated testing and code analysis.
3. **Security Scanning:** Secret leaks, Static and dynamic security analysis.
4. **Deployment:** Deployment to development, staging, and production environments.
5. **Monitoring and Incident Response:** Continuous monitoring and incident handling.

For more details on each stage, see the [Pipeline Stages](./docs/pipeline-stages.md) documentation.

## Security Practices

Security is a top priority in our DevSecOps pipeline. We follow best practices for secure coding, conduct regular security assessments, and perform vulnerability management. For more information on our security practices, see the [Security Practices](./docs/security-practices.md) documentation.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to improve our DevSecOps pipeline. If you'd like to contribute, please follow our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
